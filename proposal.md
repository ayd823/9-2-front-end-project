# Horror Movie Search

---

As a huge fan of the horror genre, one of my favorite ways to pass time, to de-stress, or to connect with others is to tune in to a good horror movie. There are so many sub-genres within horror and a variety of unique themes that can be represented that I want to make it easier to find a specific movie (or movies) that I would want to watch or share with others at any given moment.

Sometimes I'm looking for a good slasher. Or I might be in the mood for a psychological thriller. Sometimes, I just want to watch something that's so bad, I can't help but enjoy it, to the point that I'd still consider it to be worth the watch! And other times, I'm looking for something so specific, I want to be able to find the exact movie that checks off every motif I'm in the mood to experience all in one film.
